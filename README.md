- 👋 Lackson here!
- 👀 I've been enjoying Data Science since my recent introduction to it. I teach undergrad introduction to econometrics at Colorado State University using R. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects about development economics for poor countries. This, for the most part, requires working with survey data. I am working to enhance my survey data analytical skills.
- 📫 I tweet @LacksonMudenda
